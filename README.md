Base Project

Here are the steps I've taken with this project:

+Create a new repository on GitHub
+Create a new project (folder in this case) on my machine
+Initialize a Git repository in that project
+Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page
+Create an app.js file that will serve as my functionality for my site, including Author and Date of creation
+Create a stylesheet.css, no population of content needed at this time
+Link the Javascript and CSS file to your HTML file
+Check this project into GitHub
+Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the components of my projects
